# sound_Neurons

Creative coding project that draws a neuron forest based on input music.
Neuron growth and branching is based on the streamed amplitude and music tone.
To use it, simply run this code on Processing framework. Needs Sound package
to run.

Greatly inspired by work by Asher Salomon (http://www.ashersalomon.com/)
Designed and coded by Victor M. Saenger, 2019.
